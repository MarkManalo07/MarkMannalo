<h2>MARK MANALO</h2>
<p>I am Mark Angelo Manalo but you can call me baby. I am from my mother's womb. My motto in life is "Behind your smile there's a teeth. I am beginner at making a website that's why my website looks like this and I'm sorry for that.</p>

<p>I am an Island boy and I am a shy type person. I graduated from elementary and high school at calubcub 1.0 San Juan Batangas. I'm not honor student but at least I graduate. When i was in high school I thoufht I was a slow learner, now in college i understand that's true. </p>

<p>I choose BSIT because I don't know the uses of computer and its importance. I became interested in bieng IT student because I thought it was just typing. But now that I'm a IT student, let's not talk about it anymore.</p>
